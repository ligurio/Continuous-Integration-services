There are a lot of cloud [continuous
integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) services. All
of them have different set of functionality, some of them require payment, some
of them are free.  I have created a list of such
services to make easy comparison of them and choose more suitable for you.

Some of CI services has open source code thus you can setup them in standalone
mode. Pay attention to the column "Features".

There is a
[similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_continuous_integration_software)
comparison on Wikipedia.
